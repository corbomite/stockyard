<div class="photo_caption">Cover for &#8220;All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu&#8221;<br/><em>Photography Credit:<br/> <a href="http://www.rufuswainwright.com/" target="_blank">Official Promotional Photography</a></em></div>
</div>
<p>Creating a portrait of familial disconnect from an ode to his sister is the type of subversive ideal-dismantling in which Wainwright revels throughout <em>Lulu</em>. In &#8220;What Would I Ever Do With A Rose?&#8221; the singer casts himself as the lover in repose, enumerating the places where he ravishes his love. He speaks of roses, too, but here he quickly shatters the fantasy with the practicalities of real life. &#8220;What would I ever do with a rose?&#8221; he asks his lover, forsaking beauty for its own sake, &#8220;How would it ever get me by?&#8221; It&#8217;s not long before Wainwright substitutes one symbol for the other and wonders what need he has for his lover at all.</p>
<p>Romantic themes are not in short supply, but none of them is straightforward, as with &#8220;So Sad With What I Have,&#8221; a love song written in the throes of depression. He lauds his lover&#8217;s brightness, but only in contrast to his own dejected state, and declares that he&#8217;s &#8220;sad with what I have except for you.&#8221;  The plodding, plaintive melody may as well be a funeral dirge for Wainwright&#8217;s happiness&mdash;a compelling, though undoubtedly strange, choice for a man in love. </p>
<p>Perhaps at once the most inverted and the most passionate of <em>Lulu&#8217;</em>s love songs is &#8220;A Woman&#8217;s Face,&#8221; Wainwright&#8217;s musical setting of Shakespeare&#8217;s Sonnet 20. Sonnet 20, of course, is the controversial and still often-debated ode to the Bard&#8217;s &#8220;master-mistress.&#8221; This is by far the best of the three sonnets that appear on the album. Wainwright&#8217;s treatment is intuitive and charged with sexual longing, in stark contrast with the often-neutered academic debates over the sonnet&#8217;s interpretation (One scholar tells us the subject is a form of Elizabethan sports gambling). There is no doubt that this song is an expression of romantic love between one man and another, the circular, formal piano arrangement only emphasizing the illicit nature of this confession. </p>
<p>Despite his best efforts, the other two sonnet-renditions, &#8220;Shame&#8221; and &#8220;When Most I Wink,&#8221; are difficult, clunky, not so much music as a lukewarm exercise in constructing a melody around poetry. It&#8217;s an unusual, competent kind of failure, as the ebb and flow of the tunes indicate a thorough understanding of the texts themselves. Perhaps it&#8217;s not such an insult to say that he&#8217;s failed to enhance Shakespeare.  The ambition itself is staggering. </p>
<p>The album is at times alienating in its overreaching. &#8220;Les Feux D&#8217;artifice T&#8217;appellent,&#8221; an aria from Wainwright&#8217;s <em>Prima Donna</em>, is here, too, though it&#8217;s hardly clear why. Not that his voice doesn&#8217;t do the piece justice: it is beautifully rendered. Yet it&#8217;s not at all evident how the aria, the sonnets, and the ballads fit together into a cohesive work of art. The pieces are not at home with each other, but they are, of course, at home with <em>Wainwright</em>. Unfortunately, while <em>Lulu</em> has been called a concept album, it seems at times the concept is only clear to the artist himself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not difficult to see why Wainwright sometimes bites off more than he can chew. He&#8217;s profoundly talented, and if you can do it all, the impulse is to try. His opera <em>Primma Donna</em> was just one example of the heights of opulence Wainwright can reach when properly outfitted (in this case, with seventy performers).  One the other hand, <em>Lulu</em> is almost an exercise in decadence-on-a-dime. While &#8220;Les Feux D&#8217;artifice T&#8217;appellent&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to fit on <em>this</em> album, it is an awe-inspiring indication of Wainwright&#8217;s ability to scrape together a soul-stirring aria with nothing more than a piano. What he does is nearly alchemy. His skill is truly otherworldly, but in the case of this album, he could have used editing to present a clearer vision. As it stands, Wainwright&#8217;s powerful desire for unrestrained artistic expression sometimes makes it a struggle for the audience to follow along.</p>

<h2>post a comment.</h2>
<p><em>Fan of Rufus Wainwright?</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#cc0000; font-size:16px;"><a href="?show=comments" style="border-bottom:1px dotted silver; font-weight:bold;">Tell Us Why.</a></div>
<p><span class = "dropblack">G</span>iven this criticism, it&#8217;s not surprising that Wainwright has a cult fan following. He is unabashedly idiosyncratic, accessible and cryptic in turns, and those who adore him have come to expect, even relish, his unpredictability. Not to say that his work appeals only to Wainwright devotees. At times his passions draw him to niche performances like his 2006 two-night tribute performance to Judy Garland, where he recreated, note-for-note, Garland&#8217;s iconic April 23, 1961 concert in Carnegie Hall. The iconic auditorium sold out on both nights he performed, and the event became something of a zeitgeist in both gay and showtune-loving communities, spurring successful DVD and live-album releases in conjunction with the concert. </p>
<p>Unlike the Garland tribute shows, this album is all about Wainwright. Unless you&#8217;re an unusually obsessive Shakespeare enthusiast, the stripped-down nature of <em>Lulu</em> forces you to focus on the musician himself. There is nothing to relieve or distract you from his saturating voice, his overwhelming piano. With the exception of the sonnets, most of the songs&#8217; lyrics, while honest and thoughtful, are often so simple as to be unmemorable, and the hooks and melodies are few and far between. This album will appeal to people who yearn to immerse themselves in someone else&#8217;s emotions, to wallow in another person&#8217;s hurt and longing. But some, I imagine, will not want to relive the intense experience of listening to it.  </p>
<p><em>All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu</em> is not only a disconcertingly intense album&mdash;it&#8217;s downright brooding. Wainwright&#8217;s mood fluctuates at will, but all within the spectrum of powerful, negative emotions. He is at times mournful (as with the heartbreakingly beautiful &#8220;Zebulon&#8221;), then giddy with spite (&#8220;Give Me What I Want And Give It To Me Now&#8221;), and very often simply morose (&#8220;True Loves&#8221;). These songs are darkly confessional, like a midnight conversation with a lover woken from sleep by guilt. Wainwright&#8217;s performance on this record is very physical, as many of the songs are technically challenging, vocally and instrumentally. You can hear the difficulty as he dashes keys, pushes hard to hold a note, or rushes a breath. It&#8217;s exhausting, and shockingly intimate. </p>
<p>But like so many intimate moments, those on this record are often halted by awkwardness and triggered defenses. Where a lover, woken from sleep to divulge a secret, might use a laugh to break eye contact and avoid gravity, Wainwright distracts with dazzling performance. In &#8220;The Dream,&#8221; Wainwright delivers a painfully honest and beautiful sentiment: &#8220;I truly loved, which is harder to do/Than to dream of.&#8221; The elegant, brutal sincerity of the statement is drowned with swelling piano and a sudden chord change. The song is a study in momentum, ushering the listener along from crescendo to crescendo without time to process the deeply personal lyrics.</p>
<p>Wainwright&#8217;s defenses may be more artful than our own, but they are still intended to put distance between us, to distract from the unflinching intimacy of the moment. His preternatural ability to dazzle, to perform, is a defense mechanism so perfect that it seems honed by generations of evolution, like camouflage. Then again, maybe it is: music is in his genes. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to want to hear Wainwright&#8217;s secrets, despite his evasion. This album requires an inordinate amount of work to listen to, but it&#8217;s gripping nonetheless. It is not simple or easy, not something that can be undertaken without care. It&#8217;s a novel that demands a dictionary and encyclopedia, a delicate risotto that requires constant attention, a three-in-the-morning conversation with a red-eyed lover than spans a dozen cigarettes and several cups of coffee.  </p>
<p>To listen to <em>All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu</em> is to see Wainwright clearly for his brilliance and his failings, to know the flaws and idiosyncrasies of an artist in full command of his not inconsiderable genius, to endure as the writer&#8217;s tumultuous passion seeks to consume you completely. It is, perhaps, too much like love<span class = "red-period">.</span></p>
