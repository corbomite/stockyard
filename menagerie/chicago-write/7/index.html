			<p>The University of Chicago Press, founded in 1891, is among the handful of local publishers that give resident writers some preference, having published the likes of Leon Forrest, Jack Fuller and Norman Maclean, as well as a catalogue of non-fiction titles about Chicago. Ivan R. Dee Publishers has maintained a decades-long reputation for excellence (Sandburg and Dreiser are included in their list of authors they’ve kept in print), though, in a story common among smaller publishers, it just recently closed its Chicago office. There are very small publishing concerns such as featherproof books, as well as a number of literary journals produced here, and those independent presses naturally include, if not focus on, Chicago writers.</p>
<p>The Chicago Publishing Gallery came to life in October, 2008, as the first major initiative of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs’ Publishing Industry Programs. Its mission, in part, was to showcase the quality work done among Chicago’s independent publishers and in pursuit of that goal has collected more than 2,300 books from 100 books publishers and 75 periodical publishers, showcasing the titles in their space at 78 E. Washington Street.</p>
<p>“We hear so much bad news about what&#8217;s happening in publishing that it&#8217;s often hard for those outside the industry to realize that there are highly profitable, growing publishers right here,” says Danielle Chapman, Director of Publishing Industry Programs. “I was also surprised by the quality of the books put out by some of our smaller publishers. Flood Editions, Stop Smiling Books, Switchback Books, featherproof books, Other Voices Press, Rose Metal Press, these are just a few examples of small, literary publishers that are putting out important titles that really focus on beautiful writing and craftsmanship.” Chapman points out that Chicago is home to the largest university publisher (University of Chicago Press), the largest independent African-American-owned publisher (Third World Press) and the largest independent female-owned publisher in the United States (Sourcebooks).</p>
<p>Other groups, like the Chicago Book Clinic, which, among its varied interests, gives awards for the production of high-quality books, focus on the publishing side of the industry.  </p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropblack">T</span>hroughout all Chicago’s sustained periods of literary productivity, up to the present, there have been groups, publications and institutions to sustain achievement. The Cliff Dwellers, a club supporting the performing and fine arts, has been around more than 100 years, since Garland and his associates first conceived it; the Society of Midland Authors is fast approaching its 94th Annual Awards Dinner, at which it gives recognition and prizes in seven different literary categories; the Chicago Literary Club began in 1874 and still meets regularly to present essays. All three of those storied groups are housed on the 22nd floor penthouse at 220 S. Adams overlooking the Art Institute and Millennium Park, where the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame will soon call home as part of its new partnership with Cliff Dwellers.</p>
<p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em>’s Nelson Algren Awards has, for nearly 30 years, helped put writers on the map; the Tribune Foundation also sponsors the Heartland prizes honoring achievement in fiction and non-fiction; the Chicago Library Foundation’s Carl Sandburg Literary Award, given for lifetime achievement, is presented each October at the Chicago Book Festival. None of those prizes is exclusive to Chicago writers, though some naturally win the awards. The Chicago Library Foundation’s 21st Century Award, on the other hand, goes to resident writers, and has helped launch greats like Hemon. <em>Another Chicago Magazine</em>’s Chicago Literary Award is an example of ongoing contests and publications opportunities among our city’s periodicals. </p>
<p>These options, though, are scant compared to New York, and few Chicago writers could subsist on its own city’s opportunities. </p>
<p>“It&#8217;s very tough for authors to secure a place in the public square with so few newspaper book reviews left,” says <em>Booklist</em> reviewer and <em>Open Books</em> radio host Seaman. “But everything about publishing is changing rapidly, and lots of websites are starting to cover books seriously. So while it&#8217;s always a struggle, I do think there are more options now for getting the word out. But writers have to do the work. They have to have an online presence.” </p>
<blockquote style="width:300px; font-size:16px; float:right; color:#660099; padding:0px; line-height:1.8em;"><p>The city has always provided, and still does offer, a deep well of material and characters for any writer willing to look beyond the hoary superficialities and explore the terrain.</p></blockquote>
<p>This can be seen clearly at the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, which has reduced its coverage of books steadily over the last several years. In 2007, the newspaper shifted its book section from the Sunday to Saturday edition, which has significantly fewer readers. In late 2008, it eliminated its stand-alone book review section, merging it into a “Books and Media” section that includes, among other features, comics and the weather. The <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, likewise, devotes scant space to literary reviews; and though the monthly and weekly periodicals do some reviews, the sum total doesn’t approach anything like comprehensive coverage. As Seaman points out, there are many online magazines, like <em>Book Slut</em>, that offer serious, respected reviews, as well as others, like <em>Golden Rule Jones</em>, that engage in ongoing literary discussions. </p>
<p>“The city has always provided, and still does offer, a deep well of material and characters for any writer willing to look beyond the hoary superficialities and explore the terrain,” says Kogan. “There are good stories to be had out there. Of course, that’s not the same as making a living. There’s not a week that a solidly, sometimes spectacularly, written book by a Chicago writer doesn’t land on my desk. But given the chaos and uncertainty and blockbuster mentality in the publishing business, I wonder how many of these writers are getting the nurturing (and dough) they deserve for their work to be able to grow and how many will be able to stick with it.”</p>
<p>There’s little doubt, though, that Chicago’s master storytellers have benefited from their readings of past masters, or that younger writers often lack the historical context for their own literary pursuits. </p>
<p>“I read <em>Studs Lonigan</em> in high school and it made a big impression on me,” says Dybek. “I wasn&#8217;t writing enough then to be influenced, but the experience of a writer writing about a South Side hood wasn&#8217;t lost on me.  I read <em>The Man With the Golden Arm</em> in my senior year in high school, and that too was a powerful experience. Farrell made me see how the city could be shown as what it is.  But Algren&mdash;there was something transformational in him that appealed to me even more.  And of course I&#8217;d read Sandburg and Gwendolyn Brooks.  Whether in verse or prose, I especially listened for writers who could find the lyrical in the city without making it pretty in a way I knew it wasn&#8217;t.  I didn&#8217;t read Bellow until I was in college and by then I had broader reading background and knew I was reading a master prose stylist.”</p>
<p>These connections surely run through the literary community, at all levels. Wright, as a budding author, read Dreiser; Terkel so admired Farell’s beloved Studs Lonigan that he took its name; Hemingway studied Anderson; modern authors, among them Tony Fitzpatrick, whose <em>Bum Town</em> is a Chicago classic, devoured Algren. </p>
<p>But Dyja notes that, unlike architecture (or, I might add, pizza), literature does not gain the spotlight.</p>
<p>“Chicago has enough voices,” Dyja says. “When you talk about Chicago literature you’re not just talking about one person. There were amazing people. The literary history of the city is crucial to the cultural history of Chicago. But somehow the literature is not functional the way, say, architecture is. It’s a matter of marketing. Literature tells some ugly truths about the city&mdash;and that’s not attractive to Chicagoans the way pretty buildings are.”</p>

								This is a great article -- very comprehensive. Would that it were true, though that the big houses were clamoring to send there major names here. I've worked as a publicist for two of Chicago's most established indies, and over the past year we have not only noticed a reticence to include Chicago on tour calendars -- publicists have actually told us its not worth it to send writers here becuase Chicago's mainstream media does not support book culture, so they can't count on the event-related PR they rely on in the coastal cities. At least, that's the impression that's been expressed to me and some of my colleagues.							</div>

								As both President of Off Campus Writers Workshop (OCWW) which is a 64 year old group with 200 writers hosting weekly speakers on some topic of writing every Thurs. morning between 9:30AM-noon from Sept.-May each year, and as someone teaching creative writing - giving workshops in and around Chicago, I can attest firsthand to the incredible talent in Chicago and its suburbs.  At OCWW we have successful authors and writers in all genres.  In my workshops I see writers/authors expand their creative abilities having fun along the way.

In and around Chicago there is still a sense of violent critiquing that goes on - although neither at OCWW or in my workshops is that tolerated.  People learn from what works and if they want suggestions about what is not working, then those suggestions must be housed in a respectful way.  Competition can be fierce in Chicago - but there is here also a sense of comaraderie - networking, helping each other, finding solutions that is palpable.  In other locations that very comaraderie is muted by intense competition and ripping up each other's work.

Nice to read about what is going on in the writing world in Chicago.  Keep up the great work.							</div>
