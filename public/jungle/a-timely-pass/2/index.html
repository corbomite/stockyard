<p>But there was a path of least resistance available, a way for James to dominate without having to demand greatness of himself, without having to bear anyone&#8217;s hopes and dreams on his Atlan shoulders.  An opportunity developed that allowed LeBron to be little more than a prominent foot soldier, deflecting the pressures of hero worship and instead spending the next five years throwing alley-oops to his cronies as they routinely annihilate lesser competition.  </p>
<p>James probably doesn&#8217;t view his decision to sign with the Miami Heat and join forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the top two other members of this staggering free-agent class, as a deflation of his potential.  In his mind, he&#8217;s presumably still the league&#8217;s best player, only now he has backup.  Perhaps he grew weary of being counted-on and of coming up short, of being pressed and hammered on his quest for laurels and historicity.  Maybe he simply wanted to take it easy and shoot the breeze, enjoy the end of his twenties, and win in the method of every happily mediocre American.</p>
<p><span class = "dropblack">A</span>ir-conditioning.  Television.  Computers.  Cell phones.  Smart phones.  The Internet.  Facebook.  The great guiding moral of American life in the last half-century has been comfort.  The impulse is intelligible, of course.  Who would want to live on a sun-scorched desert plain without A/C or running water?  Why should anyone choose to be lonely, when they can be part of a vast online social network?  Information is everywhere, and convenience is essential.  Each individual American, if he chooses, is the warm center of his own universe, everything delivered for a price, and so much distraction providing an easy excuse for people to expect less of themselves, to skate, to float, to let <em>others</em> break their backs breaking ground.</p>
<p>LeBron James is no different.  While he sees himself as a basketball player, his stated goal is to become a &#8220;global icon,&#8221; his profession simply a means to enter the consciousness of every man, woman, and child on planet Earth.  There was a time when athletes became icons because of the championships on their resumes.  LeBron, on the other hand, was always the best at everything he attempted prior to entering the NBA.  Because of this, he matured not into a winner but into a businessman devoted to selling LeBron James, the Best at What He Does.  He&#8217;s a huckster with hops, and little more.  Gargantuan, gravity-defying jumps, but a racketeer all the same.</p>
<div class="box" style="text-align:center; float:right; margin-right:0px; margin-top:15px;">
<h2>post a comment.</h2>
<p><em>What do you think about <strongLeBron James' move to the "Heat"?</strong>?</em></h2>
<p><span style="color:#cc0000; font-size:16px;"><a href="?show=comments" style="border-bottom:1px dotted silver; font-weight:bold;">Give us your Opinion!</a></div>
<p>The television special on which he announced his decision (a program titled &#8220;The Decision&#8221;) was an hour of painfully self-unaware, uncomfortably narcissistic spectacle that managed to garner the third-highest ratings of any show appearing on cable television in 2010.  He slapped around softball questions for the show&#8217;s first thirty minutes, promoting the LeBron brand while ESPN raked in advertising dollars, before alerting the world that the next stop on his tour of global domination would be Miami, to play for the Heat, alongside Olympic teammates and fellow All-Stars Wade and Bosh, the one destination that would demand the least from him as an individual, and by proxy the one destination that will hurt his legacy and brand the most.</p>
<p>James will succeed in Miami, but no one, except for Heat fans, will be half as moved because he did it with so much buttressing, because he leaped off his pedestal, because &#8220;King James&#8221; ultimately abdicated his throne for a life of democratic deferment.  James could average a triple-double over the course of the coming season, something only one man has done in the NBA&#8217;s long history, but few would notice.  Everything he accomplishes will mean a shred of what it would have had he done so in New York, or Chicago, or Cleveland, franchises whose success would have depended almost exclusively on James approaching his limitless potential.  </p>
<p>He could have made a home in Valhalla, joining in legend the likes of Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, and Joe DiMaggio: transcendent stars, champions who defined their era in American history like no other athletes of their time.  Still, while LeBron&#8217;s decision is a reflection of the era in which he lives, it is not due to any epiphany of the sublime.  He had an opportunity to take the most classically American of paths, to leave home, go it alone, and become his own man, in the process also becoming perhaps the most important sports superstar of his age.  Instead he chose the most contemporary of American dreams: comfort, leisure, a pleasant social life, and no great fall during decline.  So eager was James to settle that he even took a pay cut.</p>
<p>There was a real chance here for LeBron to achieve the remarkable.  Blowing it, he proved, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that he&#8217;s a metonymy for America itself: a plebeian in a superhero&#8217;s clothing<span class = "red-period">.</span></p>

								"But nobody wants to live in Cleveland, much less visit it, and so the Cavaliers’ management had a tough time landing complementary talent."
It is a shame that the author choose to add this infantile and completely erroneous, snide little attack on the city of Cleveland. I am not originally from Cleveland but I have lived happily here for over 30 years. This city and metro area has so much to offer that it is beyond the scope of this reply. Cleveland is, as are so many great American cities, politically and economically bankrupt. However, it is a culturally and socially vibrant community. Mr. Gorman would be well served were he to visit and avail himself of what we have to offer. (I will be delighted to serve as your host and guide)
As for Lebron James: certainly in the short term the cavaliers will suffer in his absence. However, that will change with time. This team has had successs before the advent of Mr. James and it will enjoy success again now that he has left. 
It seems a sad commentary that so much of modern society is judged -and indeed judges itself- upon the single criteria of the "excellence" of its  teams, championships won, superstars on the rosters etc. It is time to return to reality and to accept sport for what it is: an enjoyable diversion from the day to day lives we lead regardless of what ESPN and Madison Ave would have us believe.							</div>

								Another idiot who knows nothing about Lebron James.  I hope it makes you feel a little better for a fleeting moment joining all the other sheep in the "summer to denigrate Lebron". 

 First, Lebron doesn't give a crap whether he is the star or not.  He just wants to win.  Second, the hourlong special was thought up by a friend of Lebrons as a way to make money for a charity of which they gave the Boys and Girls clubs of America 2.5 MILLION DOLLARS!!!   He could have just as easily simply flew to Miami, held a press conference and made the same announcement.  And while as you say Lebron winning a title by himself would have been remarkable, he is SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW that basketball is a TEAM game and you have to have other great players on the TEAM to win.  

I guess that makes Lebron unselfish, an amazing philanthropist, and extemely smart.  Why does that bother people so much?							</div>
