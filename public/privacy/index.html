    	<p>(As Last Updated: November 19th, 2009.)</p>
<h3>Commitment<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>Stockyard Media, Inc. (&#8220;Company&#8221;) is fervently committed to protecting your privacy on the internet and is sensitive to the expectations of its readership while visiting its websites, so this Statement on Privacy (&#8220;Statement&#8221;) has been promulgated to outline how any and all sensitive material collected by the Company&#8217;s websites is handled. Read it both fully and carefully, please.</p>
<p>(This Statement is inclusive for the Company&#8217;s network of websites; this Statement does not address other websites, including without limitation offline and online sites linked to and from the Company&#8217;s websites.)</p>
<h3>Collection<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>The STOCKYARD website (&#8220;Website&#8221;) collects personally identifying information only with the specific knowledge and consent of its users.  This information will only be collected when a user has registered for any portion of the services of the Website or otherwise willfully provided personally identifying information to the Website, such as email address, name, telephone number, and any other information such as age, location, or gender, as requested.  However, the Company cannot be held responsible for any information that has been unknowingly given on behalf of its users and cannot assure that this information will be immediately removed from its databases with or without notification.</p>
<p>As well, third parties service the Website by collecting and storing on their servers information about the computers used to access the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software used, the operating system of the machine, the referring website, and the Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) address of the computer.  That detailed information, collected by Quantcast and privately on the Company&#8217;s servers, cannot personally identify a user; it is useful to the Company for examining the statistical reach of its Product and developing new ways internally and through marketing firms to expand its market share.  This information is stored, and a syncopated version is available publicly.  Stockyard Media, Inc. is fervently dedicated to the personal privacy of its users and will not disclose the name, e-mail address, or other identifying information of any of its users without express consent.</p>
<p>All questions regarding the storage and utilization of this information should be directed to the <a href="mailto:webmaster@stockyardmag.com">Webmaster</a>.</p>
<h3>Usage<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>The Company may use personally identifying information supplied by the end user through the Website to provide that user with requested services, including any related content  which the end-user may have been opted to receive while requesting those services.  In addition, unless otherwise indicated, the Company may sell or share this information with its affiliates and with select other companies who the Company believes may offer the end-user products and services of interest.  If any end-user does not wish to have his or her personally identifying information available for this type of transaction, please contact the Webmaster.</p>
<p>While the Company will protect the personally identifying information of its end-users as outlined above, it unequivocally reserves the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymized data about its end-users as a group for any lawful business purpose, such as usage trend analysis and marketing information for potential advertisers and partners.  Furthermore, it reserves the right to use the information collected about the computer of any end-user, which may at times be able to identify him or her, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with the Company&#8217;s servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer the Website.</p>
<h3>Underage Usage<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>The Company does not knowingly collect any information from a child under the age of 13.  The Website is not intended for use by children of any age, and those children between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before accessing the Website in any fashion.  Because the Company does not collect personally identifying information without  express consent, the Company cannot be held liable for providing access to its services to those who are under the age of legal majority.</p>
<h3>Cookies<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>In order to enhance the experience of the Website, the Company or our partners may sometimes use &#8220;cookie&#8221; technology to make it easier to browse the pages of the Website and to streamline the process of certain web features.  These packets of information are simple text-based files that are common to modern Internet usage and are stored on an end-user&#8217;s hard drive.  This information is stored to aid in the navigation of the Company&#8217;s Website.  The Company does not collect personally identifying information about individual users during this process.  While visiting the Website, the end-user may also receive &#8220;cookie&#8221; information from other services on the Website, including those third parties that administer the Website or the Company&#8217;s advertisers.  The Company does not have control over the placement of this information.</p>
<p>Certain web browsers may allow the end-user to disable the collection of cookies on her or her hard drive, but take note that this may disable or disrupt certain features of the Website.</p>
<h3>Consent<span class="toam">.</span></h3>
<p>By visiting stockyardmag.com or by otherwise interacting with the Website in any manner, you, the end-user, agree that your visit and any dispute you may have regarding the protection of your privacy during such visit is subject to both this Statement on Privacy and our <a href="http://stockyardmag.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>, including without limitation the provisions regarding limitations on damages and the application of the law of the State of Illinois, County of DuPage. By visiting the Website, you also acknowledge that you have read and understand and agree to be bound by this Statement on Privacy as well as by our Usage Agreement.  If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Statement, please do not use the Website and leave immediately.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to amend, update, or modify this Statement at any time at its sole discretion and will update the language of this Statement to reflect those amendments, changes, or modifications.  Any such amendment, change, or modification shall be effective immediately upon posting on the Website.
