<p>By the time the session begins, the psychic has enough information about their new client to perform what is known as a hot reading, where the psychic uses these previously acquired personal details to achieve &#8220;hits&#8221; of accurate information. Information like the neighborhood a client lives in and the kind of credit card he or she carries can be used to make educated guesses about other aspects of the client&#8217;s life: hobbies, daily stresses, lifestyle habits. Because the client has mistaken the significance of the credit card transaction, the psychic&#8217;s uncannily true statements and often accurate guesses seem like the result of supernatural ability, and he or she is more likely to accept the validity of any prediction the psychic offers.  </p>
<p>There are, however, much more subtle techniques psychics employ to gain their clients&#8217; trust and create the illusion of psychic talent. Psychics also practice a technique called cold reading wherein they, without the use of background information, make educated guesses based on a person&#8217;s age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and personal appearance, and then they refine their guesses based on the client&#8217;s verbal and physical responses. When a prediction or statement receives a negative response, it&#8217;s immediately discarded, while those that get positive responses are reinforced and pursued. A skilled cold reader can detect such subtle shifts in body language and switch topics so deftly that the person being read is hardly aware of the process, if at all. He or she remembers the successful guesses &ndash; my husband <em>is</em> an only child, I <em>was</em> wearing my father&#8217;s watch &ndash; but not the misses. </p>
<p>This selective memory continues to hold true for predictions once the client leaves the session in the form of confirmation bias. &#8220;For example,&#8221; Lancaster illustrates, &#8220;say a psychic tells a woman that she will meet her Mr. Right in two years, and that he will be a tall, dark-haired man named David. If the woman firmly believes the psychic has supernatural abilities, she might ignore any and all suitors for the next two years. After the two years are up, she might ignore any not named David, or any without dark hair, since they could not be the Mr. Right the psychic promised.  While this may seem frivolous or far-fetched, it is quite possible.&#8221; In a similar vein, a man told he&#8217;ll be coming up on a streak of good luck might ignore the inconvenience of a flat tire or spilled coffee and pay careful attention to common positive events like finding forgotten money in a winter coat or pulling up to a parking meter with time left on it. </p>
<p>A prediction like these may be one of a dozen given by a psychic during the course of a session, but a combination of coincidental circumstances and confirmation bias leads the client to conclude that the prediction has come true. The other eleven failed predictions given during the session are, of course, forgotten in light of the apparently successful one. </p>
<p>Lancaster notes that, while all known psychics employ these tactics to achieve results during client sessions, there is the possibility that some psychics are not aware of their own trickery: &#8220;Many people who go to see psychics are predisposed to see psychic ability where there is none. If a self-deluded psychic gets enough customers like this, who tell the psychic he or she is right about every guess and prediction, the experience will reinforce their self-delusion.&#8221; Of course, for the illusion of his or her own supernatural ability to persist, the psychic must continually make correct guesses. Over the course of a long career, the odds of maintaining a high success rate become slimmer, and the psychic must begin making excuses for their misses. &#8220;The longer it goes on, the harder it would be to maintain the self-delusion,&#8221; Lancaster says. &#8220;And the most well-known psychics today &ndash; Sylvia Browne, John Edward, and James Van Praagh &ndash; have been at their game for <em>decades</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class = "dropblack">I</span>f true psychic ability is improbable, and working psychics employ tricks and educated guesses to feign supernatural ability, why is psychic advising a multi-million dollar industry? </p>
<p>&#8220;People want answers,&#8221; Lancaster says. &#8220;Answers to questions which, often, nobody else has been able to answer for them. Answers which law enforcement officials, medical providers, and loved ones cannot provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elyse Anders, founder of the Women Thinking Free Foundation and a blogger at Skepchick.org, sought answers to her own difficult questions by working as a psychic advisor herself. &#8220;I wanted to see if I could do it,&#8221; Anders says. &#8220;I knew I didn&#8217;t have any psychic powers, but I believed they existed. I decided that if I could succeed at completely fooling people, I would stop believing psychics were real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without any psychic ability, one might imagine Anders would have some trouble making her way onto Keen.com&#8217;s psychic advisor listing and setting up shop as a professional psychic. &#8220;Seriously?&#8221; Anders jokes, &#8220;All I needed was a credit card.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anders soon discovered that the website didn&#8217;t prioritize psychics&#8217; listings by level of experience, client satisfaction, or length of time on the listing. Instead, psychics bid for listing positions. &#8220;The site didn&#8217;t care who you were or what advice you gave. If you want to pay ten dollars an hour to the be the top-listed psychic, then you could be the top-listed psychic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discovery was disheartening, as at the time Anders still professed fervent belief in psychic ability. She deeply desired to acquire it herself. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I had it,&#8221; Anders says. &#8220;But I wanted to. I desperately wanted to believe that it was something real, that I could develop it. I wanted badly to know that there were people out there who could help me communicate with loved ones who&#8217;d passed away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her belief in the paranormal is far from unusual. A 2005 Gallup poll showed that, despite the preponderance of evidence to the contrary, three in four Americans believe in the paranormal. As for phenomena specifically pertaining to psychics and mediums, forty-one percent of Americans believe in extrasensory perception, twenty-six percent believe the human mind can predict the future, and twenty-one percent believe people can communicate mentally with the dead. </p>

								Beautifully well written.  I loved your ending, most of us skeptics feel the same way.  I would LOVE to be able to contact my mother and father, but wishing something does not make it so.  Thank you for including Lancaster in the interview he is truly one of our skeptic greats.							</div>
