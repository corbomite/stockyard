			<p><span class="dropblack">T</span>he thread that connects all these voices, all these eras, is Chicago itself. The city lends itself, for a variety of reasons, to literary exploration, and what’s wrong with the city is as useful as what’s right about it in a writer’s capable hands. The people assembled here, again for good and for bad, are as critical to this setting as its physical landscape. </p>
<p>“Chicago is really in a sense the capital of America,” says De Grazia. “You’re going to find the most representative stories: like the circuses and fairs of ancient literary tradition. You set the story there because it’s an environment that brings so many different elements together. Everybody goes there. Chicago is very specific and very unique, but within any Chicago novel you’re going to get a pretty wide scope of other cultures and social classes and all that. Chicagoans, more than a lot of other big city people, are real storytellers. I’m not talking about writers. I’m talking about Chicagoans. My landlord &ndash; this Serbian guy &ndash; I stop in his office and just listen to him.” </p>
<p>De Grazia is talking, in part, about Chicago’s people, which are a central part of its allure, but his characterization extends further: to the physical landscape, history and sociology of the setting. </p>
<p>“Chicago&#8217;s geography on the edge of a Great Lake with marshes filled in by hundreds of thousands of tons of slag sometimes gives rise to a haunting, even melancholy, atmosphere,” says Paretsky. “The writers whose works reflect this city make us feel both its strength and its weakness.”</p>
<p>That rich literary history is preserved throughout the city, mostly in bits and pieces or as ghosts you can see only if you’re aware of their existence. Unlike Dublin, which has dedicated a spacious museum to the systematic study of its great writers, or London, which has studiously posted blue plaques to indicate important places in the lives of its writers, or Paris, which has painstakingly made the former homes of its writers available for public display, Chicago has noted its literary contributions to the city more randomly and with more an interest in the parts than the whole.</p>
<p>The Ernest Hemingway Foundation has restored the great writers’ Oak Park birthplace to the state in which it existed during Ernest’s first six years, and also set up a museum down the block. The Oak Park Historical Society has a permanent display of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan writer and former Oak Park resident. Chicago State University is home to the Gwendolyn Brooks Foundation, which preserves her memory in the form of papers, awards, and an annual conference. </p>
<p>Just last spring, the Chicago City Council granted landmark status to Hansberry’s former home, as well as those of Wright and Brooks (Their value was seen as much in relation to the historical context of the Chicago Black Renaissance as to their merit purely as literary figures). Sandburg’s family home at 4646 N. Hermitage Ave. received landmark status in Oct. of 2006; the Sandburgs rented the second-floor in the Ravenswood two-flat from 1911-1914, the place where Sandburg wrote the poem Chicago, from which Chicago gets its famous “City of Big Shoulders” moniker. The South Holland Historical Society (16250 Wausau Ave., South Holland, IL 60423) holds a Ferber collection. The Jane Addams Hull House is a tribute to her life’s work, including her literary contributions.</p>
<p>“It’s usually better keeping buildings in active use,” says Landmark Illinois’ president Jim Peters. “Museums take a lot of money; certain homes of authors could support a large number of visitors, but that’s a rarity. This makes a lot more sense. It protects the site from being lost. It is so important to see the building in the context of the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Peters says that in his decades working in preservation, he has never known the Commission of Chicago Landmarks to decline a proposal that involved a literary site. Half of its requests come from the outside (citizen groups or members of the public) and half from the Landmarks’ staff itself. The Commission sends its recommendations to the City Council, which has final authority. In the case of the Sandburg home, there was a fear the building would be torn down, “and the city went to bat.” That said, only Sandburg, and just recently Hansberry, Brooks and Wright, have earned that status, though Algren’s home is in the Wicker Park Landmark District and so is protected in that way.</p>
<p>“You have to work pretty hard to find writers&#8217; birthplaces or the important locations of fictional events officially acknowledged in any way,” says William Savage, a Northwestern University professor who is a distinguished critic, scholar, editor and writer of Chicago literature and literary culture. “It&#8217;s gotten a bit better lately with the Chicago Tribute signs at a few places, and some plaques on writers&#8217; homes and some land-marking of other writers&#8217; homes. But compared to Paris, London, Dublin, San Francisco or New York: Chicago does the least.”</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribute Markers of Distinction program, started in 1997, has posted 80 markers around the city, including literary figures such as Algren, Margaret Anderson, L. Frank Baum, Finley Peter Dunne, Farrell, Ferber, Hansberry, Hecht, Monroe, Irna Phillips, Sandburg and Wright. Publishers such as Joseph Medill, Robert McCormick and Robert S. Abbott have also received markers. Unlike a Chicago Landmark designation, these markers offer no protection for the building or site and in many cases simply indicate a site of a building that has been demolished since the time of its link to the author. The Ferber marker at 1642 E. 56th Street, for example, is placed at the site of the old Windermere Hotel, where the author lived from the time she came to Chicago in 1910, though one of the two original buildings has been demolished and the other converted to rental units. Harriet Monroe’s marker is at 543 N. Wabash, where <em>Poetry</em> was headquartered, despite the fact that the street, known then as Cass, has changed dramatically since her time.</p>
<p>“It’s important that Chicago has a literary history,” says Barbara Koenen, the project’s coordinator. “We have a number of people who made a huge contribution to the literary landscape, who did it because they were here.” </p>
<p>Chicago Tribute Markers of Distinction plans to post 20 more of its two-sided rectangular markers this fall. The markers include photos of the subject, as well as a biography and a narrative history that includes the subject’s connection to the site, which usually is the place with the strongest link to the historical figure. Chicago Cultural Center, the Chicago Tribune Foundation and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs collaborates on the project, and considers only those candidates that have been dead a certain number of years. </p>
<p>“To understand the city you live in, you have to read the great writers,” says Eig. “You have to read Algren, you have to read Dreiser, you have to read one of my favorites, Leon Forrest, and you have to read essaysists like Joseph Epstein, who’s been a real mentor and inspiration to me. So much great writing has come out of this town, and you can only learn from it. You’d be a fool to look past it.”</p>

								This is a great article -- very comprehensive. Would that it were true, though that the big houses were clamoring to send there major names here. I've worked as a publicist for two of Chicago's most established indies, and over the past year we have not only noticed a reticence to include Chicago on tour calendars -- publicists have actually told us its not worth it to send writers here becuase Chicago's mainstream media does not support book culture, so they can't count on the event-related PR they rely on in the coastal cities. At least, that's the impression that's been expressed to me and some of my colleagues.							</div>

								As both President of Off Campus Writers Workshop (OCWW) which is a 64 year old group with 200 writers hosting weekly speakers on some topic of writing every Thurs. morning between 9:30AM-noon from Sept.-May each year, and as someone teaching creative writing - giving workshops in and around Chicago, I can attest firsthand to the incredible talent in Chicago and its suburbs.  At OCWW we have successful authors and writers in all genres.  In my workshops I see writers/authors expand their creative abilities having fun along the way.

In and around Chicago there is still a sense of violent critiquing that goes on - although neither at OCWW or in my workshops is that tolerated.  People learn from what works and if they want suggestions about what is not working, then those suggestions must be housed in a respectful way.  Competition can be fierce in Chicago - but there is here also a sense of comaraderie - networking, helping each other, finding solutions that is palpable.  In other locations that very comaraderie is muted by intense competition and ripping up each other's work.

Nice to read about what is going on in the writing world in Chicago.  Keep up the great work.							</div>
