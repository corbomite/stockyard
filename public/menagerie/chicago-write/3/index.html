<p>But first, in today’s landscape, there must be educational opportunities. There are fewer and fewer literary figures who don’t go through an MFA creative writing program. Whether that’s good or bad is open for debate, but the fact stands in the data: Turow (Stanford), Dybek (University of Iowa), Meno (Columbia College), David Sedaris (School of the Art Institute), Saunders (Syracuse University). There are also writers who get degrees in other (though often related) fields, and even those who don’t go through a proper program find it useful, if not important, to undergo uncertified workshop training. </p>
<p>“Frankly, the best education of the best writers was the streets of Chicago,” says Randy Albers, Director of Columbia College’s Creative Writing Program. “Algren and Farrell: They pretty studiously avoided academia. There certainly were wonderful writers who taught. Brooks was Columbia’s first honorary degree recipient&mdash;and she taught very early on. But, more often than not, writers went the other way&mdash;not to say they didn’t have education; the training was often in literature or some other area, they took up writing, found a community, and kind of went from there. But there’s been this huge explosion of writing programs, and especially from the 80s on the game has changed.”</p>
<p>In the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, our city boasts two of the most impressive higher education institutions in the world. U.S. News &#038; World Report ranks the universities eighth and twelfth, respectively, in the nation. Not coincidentally, each university has not only churned out a Hall of Fame list of graduate writers, but also always maintains a Hall of Fame faculty. The School of the Art Institute is uniquely situated for writers, with its emphasis on the fine arts and its rarified status in that world. All three &ndash; the University of Chicago, Northwestern, and The School of the Art Institute &ndash; offer writers a chance to explore other disciplines that eventually serve a writer well. Experience and intellectual agility are the hallmarks of great writers, and, in a narrowly-focused program, writers might learn the craft without gaining the intellectual and emotional range that is present in most great literary works. </p>
<p>Most big cities, of course, have one or two or three great universities, but Chicago’s resume is among the more impressive. Columbia College was an early leader among creative writing programs that were spawned in the wake of the establishment of the Iowa Writer’s Workshop in 1936. John Schultz founded Columbia’s program in 1967 and the graduate program was in place by 1981. Columbia offers a very contemporary curriculum &ndash; it, for example, teaches students the art of public reading &ndash; and puts on literary events like <em>Story Week</em> that, along with a sterling faculty built from the rank of its students, have helped established its reputation as a first-rate training ground. </p>
<p>“We probably have a higher percentage of working class students than a lot of programs,” says Albers, who grew up on a Minnesota farm and made his way to Columbia College via Tulane University and then the University of Chicago, where he studied English Literature and Language. He notes that Columbia students have published around 50 books in the past five years. “Our approach is meant to bring the stories of the street into the classroom. We’re not an ivory tower, and that’s on purpose; we try to keep our connection to Chicago.”</p>
<p>Loyola University and the University of Illinois-Chicago (with a small book publishing concern, Other Voices Books, as a jewel in its crown) are also fine programs, as is DePaul University, another traditional commuter school. Northeastern Illinois University, Roosevelt University and Chicago State University all have long-established writing programs. There are a variety of suburban offerings also, such as Lake Forest College, a private liberal arts school; even College of DuPage, which was once thought of as a halfway house to a better school, has successfully published authors on its faculty.</p>
<p>Of course, the formal writing programs are a huge cost&mdash;not only does the tuition tend to be untenably out-of-line with a writer’s potential return on investment, but the years (generally two to three) lost from the work force significantly alter their future. Columbia, for example, has 90 MFA-graduate fiction-writing students in its program, as well as 400 undergraduates vying for a BA or BFA in its creative writing or playwriting majors. Of those nearly 500 students, about 12 will be granted full scholarships, and another half-dozen or so will get partial scholarships. The college also grants 1,000 annual “Open Door” scholarships to Chicago students. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px; color:#666;">The Chicago Literary Hall of Fame’s mission is to promote and celebrate Chicago&#8217;s rich and proud literature tradition by honoring the authors whose words have best captured the essence of our city.</span><br/><span style="font-size:10px; font-family:Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans, sans serif;"><br />From <a href="http://www.chicagoliteraryhof.org/about.aspx" target="blank">CLHOF Website</a></span></div>
<p>A writer interested in feedback, an audience, the wisdom of an experienced mentor, a community &ndash; all those things likely to be found in a writing program &ndash; can opt for relatively inexpensive (or even free) workshops. Some of this might be found in a university’s continuing- or adult-education programs&mdash;nearly every major university offers such courses. Other opportunities are private: Story Studio, founded by Jill Pollack, offers a bank of writing classes that cover the spectrum from syntax to the short story submission process. The Writer’s Loft has been active in Jerry Cleaver’s upstairs living area for more than 20 years. Organizations like the Barrington Writers Workshop meet twice a week, every week (for more than 30 years) for serious, stringent critique sessions. The Off-Campus Writers’ Workshop, founded in 1946, offers weekly events, such as lectures and workshops, as well as manuscript consultation and other editorial services. Informal groups, such as the Hungerdungers in Lincoln Square that involves, among others, bestselling authors James Finn Garner and Jonathan Eig, handpick their peers. Still many other writers offer manuscript evaluation or run private workshops. The quality, naturally, is uneven, and the intensity not usually on par with the formal programs, but, in some cases, it’s what a writer wants, needs, or simply can manage.</p>
<p>“Chicago is a very friendly city for a writer&mdash;whether that means it’s a good city to make a career, I don’t know.” Eig, who was born in Brooklyn, grew up Rockland County, NY, and ended up here in 1995 after working newspaper jobs in New Orleans and Dallas. “Writers are very collegial and will help each other out. There’s a Midwestern geniality to it. Still, it is harder to get noticed here.”</p>
<p>Eig did get noticed, though. Both his sports biographies were critically and commercially sensational, and, with the release of a new biography on Al Capone, he’s among the few writers earning a living off their books. Before all that, though, Eig worked as a reporter for <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Chicago bureau, a job that earned him credibility in the book market while also providing a living.</p>
<p>And newspapers &ndash; though now a dying industry &ndash; were always a breeding ground for great writers, including household names like Ring Lardner, Hecht and Royko. Weekly newspapers, such as <em>The Reader</em>, <em>TimeOut Chicago</em> and <em>New City</em>, have allowed a handful of writers to scrape together small paychecks; Chicago Magazine pays some for writers and editors. In addition, there are now online efforts &ndash; such as Gapers Block, The Nervous Breakdown and Chicago Examiner &ndash; that offer marginal financial incentives for its writers and/or editors. </p>
<p>Outside of academia and major media, Chicago, of course, has jobs. Cyrus Colter was Chicago’s deputy internal revenue collector; Turow famously wrote on the commuter train as he pursued a career as an attorney; Sakey worked in advertising and design for nearly a decade before hitting it big with his first novel, <em>The Blade Itself</em>; Don DeGrazia, author of <em>American Skin</em>, worked as a laborer in plating factories and plants, as well as a doorman at The Metro (then The Cabaret Metro) during his early writing days; Stehanie Kuehnert, author of <em>Ballads of Suburbia</em> and <em>I Want to be Your Joey Ramone</em>, bartends at The Beacon Pub in Forest Park.</p>

								This is a great article -- very comprehensive. Would that it were true, though that the big houses were clamoring to send there major names here. I've worked as a publicist for two of Chicago's most established indies, and over the past year we have not only noticed a reticence to include Chicago on tour calendars -- publicists have actually told us its not worth it to send writers here becuase Chicago's mainstream media does not support book culture, so they can't count on the event-related PR they rely on in the coastal cities. At least, that's the impression that's been expressed to me and some of my colleagues.							</div>

								As both President of Off Campus Writers Workshop (OCWW) which is a 64 year old group with 200 writers hosting weekly speakers on some topic of writing every Thurs. morning between 9:30AM-noon from Sept.-May each year, and as someone teaching creative writing - giving workshops in and around Chicago, I can attest firsthand to the incredible talent in Chicago and its suburbs.  At OCWW we have successful authors and writers in all genres.  In my workshops I see writers/authors expand their creative abilities having fun along the way.

In and around Chicago there is still a sense of violent critiquing that goes on - although neither at OCWW or in my workshops is that tolerated.  People learn from what works and if they want suggestions about what is not working, then those suggestions must be housed in a respectful way.  Competition can be fierce in Chicago - but there is here also a sense of comaraderie - networking, helping each other, finding solutions that is palpable.  In other locations that very comaraderie is muted by intense competition and ripping up each other's work.

Nice to read about what is going on in the writing world in Chicago.  Keep up the great work.							</div>
