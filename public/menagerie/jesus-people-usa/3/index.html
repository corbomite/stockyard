<div class="photo_caption"><em></em><br /><em>Photo Credit: Taylor Burton</em></div>
</div>
<p>As we stroll to the cafeteria, I notice that my host enjoys something of a celebrity status in the halls of Friendly Towers.  To the loving nods of his fellow worshipers, he replies, &#8220;Greetings, Brother So and So,&#8221; or &#8220;How are you, Sister So and So?&#8221;   The cook was undoubtedly a different kind of Christian.</p>
<p>Today, at the same hour as my last visit, the cafeteria has <em>already</em> prepared its lunch, and a full house greet us as we promenade inside. At the table, I apprehensively eye the food that sits in a line of stainless-steel serving bins.  In a stunning feat of frugality, the second solid meal of the day bubbles and hisses as a nod to Old Country Buffet with a dollar-store twist. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, what is this?&#8221; the coordinator asks one of the cooks off to the side.</p>
<p>The cook walks over and stares at the bin of coagulated yellow goop and says, &#8220;I dunno.  Chicken dumpling, I think.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to break bread with us if you want,&#8221; the coordinator reassures. </p>
<p>&#8220;I had a big breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class = "dropblack">O</span>ne concern in the <em>Tribune</em> article was the omnipotence of the commune&#8217;s governing body, a council of nine unelected, indefinitely tenured elders with one common qualification: they have been selected by God. The commune&#8217;s directions and decisions lie in the hands of these nine people; anything of importance that goes on in the commune must bear their stamp of approval, including all financial activity. As if it isn&#8217;t suspect enough that these leaders enjoy absolute power, the article also points out that half of them are related by either blood or marriage. In 1999 there was a request submitted in writing by two concerned, long-term JPUSA members that, among other things, appealed for term limits on the elders&#8217; service.  The result was their immediate expulsion from Friendly Towers and JPUSA.</p>
<p>While I am talking with my coordinator, a young woman walks up, sits at our table, nuzzles her head in his shoulder, and closes her eyes peacefully as he ruminates. With a grin, he soon introduces her as his daughter.  At an age commonly associated with restless protest, she has no problem showing her affection for her father to a perfect stranger. Close proximity to one another has had an effect on their relationship. Her best friends live only a few doors away, so even while she engages in socially independent activities, she is never too far away. This knowledge struck my chest with a dull pulse of spreading discomfort. An arrhythmic heart beats in the breast of this commune, a blurred portent of something utterly rotten. The feeling is usually elusive, however, like indigestion without a culprit.  The man&#8217;s daughter extends me another invitation to eat the food.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family&#8217;s been living in Friendly Towers for three years now,&#8221; the man says.</p>
<p> &#8220;And it&#8217;s been good?&#8221; I ask offhandedly. </p>
<p>&#8220;Best three years of our lives.&#8221; </p>
<p>I decide, now, to ask about JPUSA&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>My host promptly admits that it is indeed an unelected elder council and that the holy nine basically call the shots. </p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been around long enough to see a new one join the council or an old one get retired,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Then he adds, &#8220;The council is what it is, and that&#8217;s just it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fingered the hot button.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve always trusted them?&#8221;  I ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been good.&#8221; </p>

</div>
<p><span class = "dropblack">B</span>efore walking me to the door, my host feels it necessary to show me the &#8220;Worship Room&#8221; again.  To get a ticket to any other part of the compound, I must go through the application process and be initiated as a temporary member. He explains the plans to open the new &#8220;Worship Room,&#8221; a larger one, in the recently acquired building across the street.  They will kick the church out of their home, I must understand, to &#8220;accommodate the growing congregation.&#8221;  With even more excitement, he notes that the new building will also house an updated recording studio and add much-needed space for the other growing businesses.  The building will need months of remodeling, however; and some of the work will be done by professional contractors, while the members will take care of the rest. The essentials are plain: business proliferation and real-estate acquisition.  Here in this ancient monument to the racket of Capone, some will ask, is it the flock or the shepherds who prosper?</p>
<p>Standing in the main lobby, I am handed an application called the Covenant.  The form, sparse on religious and organizational details, serves as a legal contract committing the acolyte to communal wealth and the political authority of the elders.  My host, his friendly countenance returned, tells me that the Covenant isn&#8217;t to be taken too seriously, that it&#8217;s &#8220;a bit&#8221; outdated.  While signing the Covenant  in the presence of the council and a notary public was mandatory in earlier days, he claims he&#8217;s not had to do so in his three years here.  Regardless of the legal and ceremonial pageantry, it still remains the official rule. </p>
<p>As I leave the lobby, I catch a parting glimpse of the Jesus banner. Most religious groups I&#8217;ve encountered devote significant resources to the preservation of their idols. It occurs to me that it would be difficult to kneel in front of this icon with any prolonged display of reverence. Partly this owes to the condition of the floors, but mostly it&#8217;s because their savior is shamed, put behind bars. Out of charity, I could volunteer to disassemble the scaffold and kick over ten dollars to have the banner cleaned, but I don&#8217;t think anyone would notice<span class = "red-period">.</span></p>

								This may be a glimpse of the beginning of the end of organized religion. I stress MAY BE. An commune of burnouts, beggars, and bumpkins (extreme yes, but my style; absolutely) in the name of Jesus says only one thing to me; desperation. That, or the 'holy nine' you mention are more evil than imaginable.  But a non profit commune, complete with, from what it sounds like, almost complete segregation of the outside world seems like quite the reversion to me, especially for christians. Then again there is no fluidity in the marginal sects of protestants. They, for the most part, worship in a manner as they please. The fact that this place is in existence is quite interesting. And though I take every chance I get to bash religion, this article makes me somewhat sad and I cannot explain why.							</div>

								Very interesting article, sounds like it was a unique experience. I would love to know more about the children in the community. Also, I was surprised to see how much this reminded me of the kibbutzim in Israel.							</div>

								I'd be interested to see some interviews with/ research on this "holy nine" you talk about.  Do they have summer homes in the country?  gold watches and diamond rings?  secret accounts?  all the article says is that they're using the commune's money to build a church.  The sentiments you express here seem to be based more on prejudice (and an extremely sensitive nose) than on the actual facts of the situation.  I don't have any stake in defending JPUSA, I'd just rather spend my time reading analysis of facts, not unsubstantiated musings.							</div>

								I actually found some of the Trib's journalism in that article pretty sloppy. 

I agree that the author could have spent a few more days there and a little more time interviewing, but I think I got a better feeling for the place than I did with the Trib.							</div>

							<div style="line-height:1.5em;">
								This is good writing, but the journalism is lacking. I was hoping for more new information to come out about JPUSA in this piece, but really, you just went on two tours of their downtown headquarters, got creeped out, and then went home and did some thorough research. As it is, this piece comes across as "indigestion without a culprit." The Jesus banner was depressing and you saw some bummed out old people (but seriously, when have you ever seen a happy old person?) but other than that, you're not a primary source for any adult spanking or anything but a vague sense of totalitarianism. You do a good job casting the coordinator in a creepy light, but the most sinsiter thing you manage to say about him is that he's over-caffeinated. It's too bad you couldn't talk to some disaffected Jesus People like the Tribune article did.							</div>
