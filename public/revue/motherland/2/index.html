<p>Following a few <em>hellos</em> and a coma brought on by jetlag, I awakened to the first day of my excursion. So began a rush of days slipping like grains of sand through the neck of an hourglass, each very similar to the next.</p>
<p>We would have a sweetly languorous family breakfast early on.  During the week, while my uncle worked at the auto garage and my aunt ran her bakery, Ania and I would explore Tychy and the nearby Katowice, sometimes running errands, sometimes just strolling through the town and stopping to chat with acquaintances on the street. Ania pointed out with pride the new superstore that had opened up in the neighborhood. Comparable to a standard American Walgreens, it dwarfed the surrounding kiosks. Further down the street we saw another novelty: last year, the very first drive-through opened in Tychy&mdash;a KFC. I did my best to feign interest at every newsworthy stop that is standard fare back home.  A newspaper advertisement praised the most cutting-edge MP3 player, now boasting a capacity of one gigabyte.  On the weekends, meanwhile, we made excursions to the Wawel Castle and the market square by the Wisla River in Kraków, and the extensive royal gardens in Pszczyna. Food, drink, souvenirs&mdash;my uncle and aunt insisted on taking care of everything, vehemently refusing to let me make use of my saved travel funds. </p>
<p>Belatedly, I noticed an unpleasant sensation that had been seeping in slowly, from the very beginning of my trip. It now permeated the once-carefree vacation air. The warmth with which my extended relatives welcomed the wayward niece far surpassed that which is owed to someone who neglected to write for years on end and, on occasion, reluctantly accepted the phone from her mother for a one-minute conversation, only to rush it back to her mother as if it were a burning coal. I had not considered that, because of my presence in her room, Ania was sleeping on a mattress located on the floor of my aunt and uncle&#8217;s bedroom. She would have taken the fold-out couch in the living room, but her sister Agnieszka, now married and expecting, quartered there with her husband Tomasz while he saved up his earnings for a residence of their own. My aunt, after preparing breakfast for all, would slowly make her way to her job at the bakery so that the family could continue to afford the hospital bills for her leg surgery, resulting from a car accident a few months ago that she was still recovering from. All this, and they spared no expense when it came to my entertainment. </p>
<p>It became all too evident that these days had been but a microcosm representative of a much longer pattern. My recollections were further augmented. Barely a week ago, I remembered the constant moving of my childhood, but not the fact that each time the relocation was to a better school district, away from the inner city institutions that sent me home in tears on a nearly weekly basis because of the theft of my homework and other possessions. I remembered walking home after the final bell and spending time alone for hours on end, but not the fact that my mother was absent because she was at her third job of the day to ensure living space and food for the week. I remembered, later on, her anger upon returning from work to be confronted by a quarrel between me and my sister or me and my stepfather, but not the fact that I filled the precious few leisure hours she had to herself with stress and conflict. I felt my insides rend as I remembered my mother&#8217;s face during our arguments over what I was not able to do.  I could scarcely comprehend the anger and frustration she must have felt to have to tell me <em>no</em>. I felt further tearing at the realization of a message she never once uttered aloud: <em> Think of how good you have it, here in America</em>.</p>
<p><span class = "dropblack">A</span>s the second week progressed, I became the model guest. I marveled at every sight regardless of its international magnitude. I put forth every effort to assist my aunt with household chores and worked to show the extent of my appreciation for every courtesy. Yet the unpleasantness remained, albeit in a different manifestation. I thought back to everything I had ever desired and everything I wished to accomplish in the future. My continued longing for an escape haunted my thoughts as a betrayal of my roots and family identity.</p>
<p>Over ice cream at an outdoor cafe in Pszczyna, I spoke with Ania on the topic, asking her if she ever felt the desire to leave Tychy and strike out on her own. I was surprised when she informed me that my mother had extended her the invitation to stay with us and look for a job in America, and I was shocked to learned that she declined. &#8220;What would I possibly do there? My family is here,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Besides, I want my children to know their grandparents.&#8221; For her, the time horizon of such a life-changing experience was most likely the next five years. </p>
<p>She finished a secondary school specialization in the field of biochemical engineering. Sadly, due to government limits on educational enrollment, she was not given a place in any of Poland&#8217;s institutes of higher education. She now held a job sweeping up at construction sites across town. Agnieszka had recently secured a job as a cashier at the new superstore, but her ideal position would be at a hair and nail salon. Nevertheless, listening to the excitement with which Ania discussed Agnieszka&#8217;s coming baby and the growing family, I felt no sorrow for their future. My family was happy, and that is wealth beyond comprehension for many of those with even the largest living rooms and big-screen televisions. I did understand, though, that this was a life Ania and Agnieszka had chosen for themselves. They were raised here in Tychy: life as such is everything they knew.</p>
<p>Had we remained in Poland, I would probably have shared their fate&mdash;working at a grocery store, married, possibly already a mother. My own mother gave birth to me when she was only twenty years old, an idea I could barely fathom as I quickly approached the same age. I wondered if I would be content in such a position, even if I did not have a strong sense of other options. A fact of which I was certain, however, was that my mother was not content.  She dedicated the better part of her life ensuring that I had every opportunity at hand, rather than simply buying into the ephemeral notion of a country filled with golden streets and Big Macs. </p>
<p>In a few short days I was to be off to the States once more, then college, then law school, and finally, in the semi-distant future, a full-time corporate career. I still felt strong regret at the difficulties I posed for my mother while I was maturing and even stronger resolve to make the most of everything she made possible without taking it for granted. Once the ice cream was finished, I noticed that the weight bearing down on my shoulders seemed to dissipate along with the remains of the sweet vanilla that had lingered on my lips. Where I had previously lacked understanding, I had perhaps redeemed myself by pursuing that very escape, fulfilling her highest hopes by desiring everything we both lacked in our youth and putting every effort into making that a reality. The little townhouse in the northwest suburbs of Chicago no longer held a shortly roped anchor but a brightly lit beacon, forever to call me home regardless of my wanderings<span class = red-period">.</span></p>
