<p><span class = "dropblack">A</span>&#038;E claims that <em>Intervention</em> is about the &#8220;route to redemption,&#8221; but considering that the stage is overwhelmingly devoted to that from which these addicts need redeeming, it would seem that A&#038;E&#8217;s Heracles was a filicide only. So if the atonement is to be glossed over in favor of the crime, then at what sort of viewer do the program&#8217;s producers aim? Are we meant to believe that the trials of addicts are whored out for the benefit of the recreationally hung-over? Assuredly not, for such an audience&#8217;s viewing is too casual and serendipitous to take the program seriously or purchase the DVDs. No, this circus has a more focused message, and someone on the Emmy Award selection panel found it compelling. Our ex-model in the headdress is incoherently explaining the finer points of Voodoo while stroking the black hair of a doll. She looks ridiculous, insane, and in the moment that she stares at the camera lens, stares at <em>us</em>, a black screen with white block letters politely informs us both that DAWN INJECTED METH A FEW HOURS AGO and that the EFFECTS CAN LAST FOR UP TO SIXTEEN HOURS. The editor, the one who chose that precise moment when Dawn stares with her bulging eyes, even dutifully cited his source of medical information. And when a cameraman is sitting in the passenger seat of Dawn&#8217;s car, aiming his lens mere inches from her weathered face as she sobs behind the wheel and demands that he leave her in peace, our concerned film editor, the one who wants to make sure <em>that we get it</em>, cuts to another helpful black screen in which we are informed that DAWN ASKED THE CREW TO LEAVE. I imagine that the walls of A&#038;E&#8217;s offices are smeared with a fresco of the Demi-God, driven into a mad rage by a jealous Hera, laying waste to his family. The insane hero advances on his child and the painting cuts to a black panel with neat white text informing us that HERACLES SLAYS HIS CHILD. The Emmy selection panel pats the editor on the back while the hung-over laugh.</p>

<p><em>Fan or Foe of Intervention?</em></h2>
<p><span style="color:#cc0000; font-size:16px;"><a href="?show=comments" style="border-bottom:1px dotted silver; font-weight:bold;">Tell us Why.</a></div>
<p>Until A&#038;E proves me otherwise through statistical analysis of <em>Intervention&#8217;</em>s ratings, I am forced to worry that the program&#8217;s target audience is composed of those who need the hand-holding and those who enjoy the flaming hoops. What better way to supplement a child&#8217;s education about the dangers of drugs than cotton candy and a front-row seat to see a tortured, cracked-out animal on display? Junior can come along with those faceless cameramen as they circle and prod their pathetic subjects, and all the while that nice portrait of the Reagans that you hung in the living room can smile down upon him. And we can bear the few minutes of tears and hugs and heart-felt letters read aloud as long as we may laugh at a homeless alcoholic while our own livers lick their wounds. And we can suffer the possibility that the poor, abused crack-head might actually stay sober as long as we may revel in fifty minutes of proof that he is <em>no good</em>. And all the while a cameraman goes home after work feeling really good about the great close-up he got when he immortalized Fabian injecting speed or Dawn smoking meth.</p>
<p>The first episode of <em>Intervention</em>, in which we meet Alyson, includes film from an amateur documentary that Alyson&#8217;s mother had begun about her daughter&#8217;s addiction. Alyson lies in her room, the curtains perpetually drawn, while mother captures her daughter&#8217;s, and her own, suffering. The camcorder was poor of quality, and the room is dark, so the resulting footage is blue and grainy. Yet we can clearly see Alyson look straight into the camera with furious tears in her eyes while she demands of her mother, <em>Do you like recording me like this? Do you like it?</em> For any reasonable viewer, it is easy to answer the question. Alyson, your mother loves you and it breaks her heart to see you like this. No, she does not like recording you, because she hates that you <em>are</em> like this. But <em>I</em> must confess, even though what I say sickens me. Your mother might not like you like this, she might not enjoy recording you like this, but we do<span class = "red-period">.</span></p>

								I'm sorry Allie, but what "negative stereotypes surrounding addiction" is "Intervention" trying to dispel? Are there some positive aspects of substance abuse that this article glosses over?

It's human nature to be fascinated by disasters that don't affect us personally. We gossip most enthusiastically about the deaths and divorces of casual acquaintances. We create traffic jams in our eagerness to ogle car crashes. No one wants to admit that this stuff is fascinating, and of course we need to maintain our own comfortable distance from these dark crevasses of the human experience, so we tack a tearful intervention onto the end of the Crackhead parade and turn off the TV telling oursleves that everything is OK. I can't deny the sick thrill I get from watching Allison sing "I'm walking on sunshine" in a croaky voice while high on film cleaner. I, for one, am honest with myself about why I like this show so much.							</div>

								This show does not glamorize, downplay, or exaggerate addiction. It documents. I'll assume you've never been an addict or been to close to one who has, because A&amp;E does not show us a "circus," but paints a very accurate picture of addiction. Not every Intervention is as eventful as Cristy's; in fact, some are downright 'boring.' But these "spectacles" and "circuses" you speak of are actually, um, exactly what an addict's world is like. And the intervention itself gets plenty of attention. What show are you watching? It normally gets a half hour. This article really does nothing but reinforce the negative stereotypes surrounding addiction that Intervention aims to silence. Instead of attacking viewers of a show that deals with real problems, why not attack the vapid watchers of, say, Jersey Shore?							</div>
