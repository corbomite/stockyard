<h2>post a comment.</h2>
<p><em>Outraged?  Horrified?</em></h2>
<p><span style="color:#cc0000; font-size:16px;"><a href="?show=comments" style="border-bottom:1px dotted silver; font-weight:bold;">Tell us Why.</a></div>
<p><span class = "dropblack">E</span>very neurosis has a diagnosis, and the pedophile in her reading chair is no real riddle on the psychoanalyst&#8217;s couch.  For the predators of Edward Cullen, the adult life starts with a shove on the shoulders and a creaking in the cot and a dream of always waking to roses.  But then the belly swells and the bosom sags, its eyes too dilated, cracked, and purple to mesmerize; and a crook in the cradle makes a stink in the night for years until his swaddle surrounds still another.  The husband sleeps with his work, life begins to ladle its yawns, and what lingers of love is littered among the rapist rompings of <em>Lifetime</em>.  It is laid down among those seedy submissions as well as the pubescent pulsations of <em>Twilight</em>, whose fictions the desperate housewife fondles while her husband makes love to his labor.</p>
<p>On the website known as cafemom.com, a popular community among such has-beens and never-wills, a coven called &#8220;twilight obsessed moms!&#8221; shows just how many homemakers wish a boy named Edward Cullen could deflower them once more.  Here, the obsolescent stalks the adolescent with a communal encouragement: steadily growing, its membership now comprises 3,775 mothers, most of whom are middle-aged and handfuls of whom already walk in the middle of their cleavage.</p>
<p>Some of the members despair of their pedophilia. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think our husbands will ever understand,&#8221; one writes, expressing a common secret.</p>
<p>Others embrace their nostalgic desire to copulate with children. &#8220;Nothing to be ashamed of,&#8221; says another mother (Her and others&#8217; grammar, except in capitalization, has been preserved).  &#8220;We all need [a] thing to make our lives a little better, no matter what it is.&#8221;  (Notice, here, the hint of a sociopath&#8217;s snobbery.)  &#8220;So what if it is a 17 yr old virgin vampire or a 15 yr old werewolf that gets our blood boiling[?]  At least it lets us know that we are alive!!!  Besides its not like ur the only one whose obsessed[:] there&#8217;s a whole bunch of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, for example, the merchandise-minded mommies who hope to paste onto the bedside wall a six-foot sticker of Edward&#8217;s silhouette, available for purchase on the online stores of opportunists everywhere.  &#8220;Ohhh….  I want one,&#8221; says a mother of two from Oklahoma, who is obese and &#8220;Christian.&#8221; (To insinuate her cruel intentions, she ends her confession with a winking emoticon.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Sexy,&#8221; responds a sister in vice, here a Texan mother of one, whose profile reveals that she stays home all day, is &#8220;stressed,&#8221; and has developed an interest in &#8220;dining out.&#8221;  She asks whether it would be appropriate to buy a second sticker, of Jacob Black, the fifteen-year-old werewolf, so that she may juggle her partners as it pleases her. &#8220;I just turn over! Woooo love it!&#8221;  (Leaving less to the imagination than her Oklahoman accomplice, this straight shooter&#8217;s endgame is an emoticon unfurling its tongue for a money shot.)</p>
<p>Because the onanist adolescent is not abundant of sexual stamina, the conversation regularly runs to the bookend of sex: the bathroom.  &#8220;I know I&#8217;m discusting,&#8221; says an uneducated mother of one, but &#8220;do you girlies ever wonder … [whether] vampires also go to the restroom … since they dont eat they just drink blood?  I wontder if they really do go [to the] restroom [or] if it&#8217;s just a bunch of blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>,&#8221; replies a more trained reader, &#8220;Bella makes a reference to that very notion.  She said after she was turned [to a vampire] and Edward and her spent [their] first night in their cottage … that they wouldn&#8217;t even have to stop making love long enough to use the bathroom cuz they didn&#8217;t need to.&#8221;</p>

								An inaccuracy in this essay.  

Meyer's parents were barely church acquaintances of her future husband's family when she was a child.  This isn't 'Big Love.'  She wasn't betrothed to him at birth.  The couple reacquainted after college, dated and married.

Human beings that enter into long term, monogamous relationships do get bored sexually w/each other.  They turn to fantasies, shared and unshared, to 'keep the spark alive' in order to stay committed to that partner.

Middle-aged people do tend to pack on the pounds in this day and age unless they are hyper vigilant re: food and exercise.  

Pot boiler, escapist fiction has always been an enjoyable, accessible entertainment.

Half the people you come in contact w/daily are functioning illiterates.  The internet just allows you access to their grammatical short comings and poor spelling.

What's the big deal?

Write an essay about why we never hear about spontaneous combustion anymore.  Now THAT would be interesting.

I'd also like to add that 'hatetwilight BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!' is one of the most over invested  comment poster I've come across in a long while.  Kudos!  Also, scary!

I am dying here. Grown ass women wetting themselves over a TEEN-AGE BOY is hilarious. It doesn't matter if he's eight hundred years old mentally. He looks like a teen-age boy and always will. There is a clear double standard here.
What if their husbands were getting a hard on about Bella and her obvious doormat qualities? 
What if their husbands turned to them and said you really need to be easily led and controlled like Bella?

They'd go off and they know it. It is not acceptable for a grown woman to moon over teen-age boys just as it is unacceptable for grown men to do the same concerning teen-age girls. Society has a name for that. Pedophile and nothing but. But then SM might be down since she has obvious child grooming going on with the imprinting mess and Jacob and Quil fixating on children. A man shagging a girl he helped raise is the depths of filth and for this crap to be accepted by Twilighters and SM herself is seriously disgusting.

Edward is no gentlemen or paragon of what a man should be. He is a functional sociopath and Bella is the perfect victim type for him. Easily led,highly stupid,and blinded by good looks instead of character. Women and girls who call him the BESTEST MAN EVER are clear candidates for future stalkers and/or winding up on an episode of Forensic Files. Edward's behavior is deranged and Bella is the biggest Mary Sue who ever Mary Sue'd in literature.
She is a clear insert for SM and her character is so blank that certain romance starved adult women and high school girls who can't pay a boy for a date can become her. She is the real reason for the success of these books and it is a sad commentary that so many females have gone mad over a character who not only is a Mary Sue but has no sense,self-esteem,and no sense of life without a man. SM clearly is anti-feminist and it shows in ALL the books. Women who fall for this lulz clearly desire to be treated in this manner. Let a man take care of everything while you sit back and simper/faint is Twilight's overall theme. Leah looks like The Phantom of The Opera but is perfectly happy to stay with the man who sliced her like salami. Bella tried to kill herself over a break-up. Leah is portrayed as bitter because her ho cousin took her man. Renee is a twit. Rosalie has baby rabies and so does Esme. Alice is nothing more than a prancing fairy. I wonder if SM truly dislikes her gender.

Edward is a fairy and not a vampire. To call him one is the height of lulz. To suggest these books are some epic love story is an insult to truly epic love stores. They are about a sparkly control freak/sociopath who locks down on a perfect victim who happens to smell like steak and taters to him.

Going gaga over a fairy who stalks,controls,makes ALL the decisions in the relationships and basically leads Bella ,a chick who is basically a selfish,stupid,and unlikable twit,around on his leash is insane. From Twilight to Breaking WTF,there are clear examples of dominance,abuse,and control. Love,my ass. 

An adult woman that is possessed of common sense should be able to detect the foul messages in these books.							</div>

								Loving? He threatens to kill himself. Respectful? HE WATCES HER WHILE SHE SLEEPS. Look through a list of signs of an abusive relationship, and you'll find at least three that apply to these books. This isn't a love series, it's an infatuation series. Now, if it was any other boy watching you sleep, would you still squeal in joy? I think not, and Edward is not a 'special case' as so many claim; being a vampire makes not one iota of difference. You may call me overly feminist ("You just don't know twu wuv!!1!"), but I AM actually one of those girls who goes for romantic things. However, even as a hopeless romantic I can still identify the multitude of problems regarding Bella's "romance". So stop making special cases for Edward, and calling him noble and such. Look through it again, ignoring the paranormal nonsense, and you'll notice a lot of flaws in these novels. 

Also, if you're going to make a point, don't do it in misspelled text jargon. You come off sounding more like an idiotic teenaged girl than a real human being.							</div>

								Sir, I love your article and congratulate you on your bravery. It is true that Twilight is nothing but some woman's fantasy. I am a woman, read the series and thought they were nothing but a girl trying to decide whether she prefers necrophilia (Edward Mcsparkles) or bestiality (Jacob puppy boy). The last book was especially disturbing with half vampire half human spawn and the pedophilia that goes on in the last book when pedowolf "imprints" on the mini mary sue.							</div>

								HOLD THE PRESSES!! I read the comments and they're stupider than a lobotomized mink.

you are a completely bias arrogant moron

you are a completely bias shoulda study english back in grade schools eh

I’ll bet that vibrator has made me women happy that you ever will

Because if it isn't sex, it isn't fun. I've heard this before simply because my classmates are stupid. Can you validate this sentence, or will you come off looking like a moron who Googles "69" just to show off to her friends?

oh, wait, you’ll NEVER be a real man.

Because manhood is reflected in writing, always. ALWAYS.

So, basically, this ‘Rory’ is just some overweight, middle-aged man who hasn’t been laid in forever and feels the need to take his anger over these facts out on something that he doesn’t understand. 

Remember kids, if you don't agree with somebody, it must be because they're ugly.

.Yes the Main charecter is a vampire and is 109 so WTF!!!!!! Can you say fantasy

Yes, but I prefer to say pedophilia.

Any real arguments here? I could do this all day... the sad part is that I'm not even out of high school yet but to an unbiased reader I'd probably come off looking much older than you all. Insert a quarter and try again.

								L.O.L at some of these comments..."You just don't like it cuz you haz a small penizzz!", "OMG YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME AND WORSHIP TWILIGHT YOU MUST BE INSECURE!!!!!!111!!!", "Anyone who hates Twilight doesn't have twu wuvs!". Utter bullshit.

Some of  these women make me sad for my gender(which is female, before any of you decide to throw a hissy fit and tell me that I have a small penis..and yes, I do have someone to love..before any of you try to throw that one at me like you do to everyone else who doesn't worship your damn book.). They've basically just proven that they're crazy and intolerant as hell of other people. Sad. It's just a damn book. 

Sometimes I think that when some of these women hear "Edward and Bella's love isn't real or is abusive/Edward or Bella sucks/etc" they actually hear "Edward and MY love isn't real or is abusive/My perfect man and I suck/etc"....Bella IS a self-insert character, after all. 

Fans like these are the reason people HATE Twilight and it's fans...							</div>

								All these people who claim to be women and mothers and are insulting the writer with nothing but insulting, shrill, emotional, logical fallacies filled words just embarrass me to be female.

I don't mind the young fans when they insult and throw hissy fits. They're still young and are still growing up. 

But you women? 

Who mock this writer and have nothing better to say but 'whiny' and 'pathetic' are the worst fans of the fanbase because, holy hell, you are all adults. 

You can't grow up because you ARE grown up and this is how you act when a less-than-flattering view comes out about your precious books? 

I'm a full blown bibliophile and even I didn't react this badly when someone insulted books like the The Giver or Lolita.

And look at you all, ganging up on this guy like it is middle school all over again on the new, funny kid. It's just a shock that a book series can turn full blown adults in a haggle of mean spirited, bad tempered children when something they love gets questioned or challenged.

I honestly feel bad for any of the kids these mothers have, especially the little impressionable ones.							</div>

								I laughed so hard while I read this. Well played, good sir or ma'am. Well played. 
Though I will admit that I cringed every time you referred to Meyer as a "children's" author. The glorified morals she unknowingly - a sign of her inexperience as a writer - tries to impart through her writing are the stuff of nightmares, and should be kept well away from children until they are no longer impressionable enough to fall for them. Morals that glorify an emotionally abusive relationship, stalking, vanity above all else, pedophilia and phaedophila, and so much more... It's enough to make me ill...							</div>

								Edward is not a perfect man. Edward is a horrible man - controlling, petty, and jealous, with a nasty sense of humor (ever notice he only laughs at people making fools of themselves). He sulks and whines whenever Bella makes a reasonable request (Don't drive so fast, it scares me. Don't listen in on my conversations, it's an invasion of my privacy. It's not your business who I go see in my free time, it doesn't give you the right to kidnap me, follow me, or break my car.) He is never the slightest bit respectful, because respect would entail subduing his massive ego some.

I do disagree with this article, because it is not pedophilia to be attracted to someone who is post-pubescent, and there really isn't much difference between a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old boy. The most deviant sexuality Twimoms can be accused of is pederasty, and maybe necrophilia. Pedophilia is encouraged in the books, with the whole imprinting mess making child grooming "romantic", and the 15-year-old Jacob is more questionable pederasty, depending on how fast the kid developed.

In short, though, I'm glad that I am with a man who is good on the outside and on the inside, which Edward Cullen is not. Ask yourselves, if it wasn't hammered in on every page how gorgeous Edward is and how he represents eternal youth, limitless wealth, and fantastic sex, would he be even remotely attractive? His personality is exceedingly ugly, so I get the feeling no one would be buying a glittering sex toy.							</div>

								It seriously creeped me out that you were writing about little boys' penises until I realized "Tantus, Inc" wasn't a snooty metaphor you were using for consumerism but an actual company. I really had to give you the benefit of the doubt there. OHH, and now that I look at the website I realize THAT'S what you were quoting when you said "toss it in the fridge for that authentic experience" -- I thought you were digging up some weird part of the Twilight books no one had told me about.

The customer responses to "The Vamp" are pretty hilarious, particularly the one who said "I ordered four, let's hope they all fit under my snuggie." I'm a little worried that no one takes this as seriously as you do.

								Oh, and when I say YOUNGER, I don't mean I'm some 16 year old obsessed fangirl.  I mean I'm not some 'middle aged hag.'  I'm over the legal drinking age, but younger than 30.  The fact that this article continually puts women down due to their age, weight, grammar/spelling, etc, is not only rude, it's petty and cheap.  Do you really feel the need to put women down because you're so inferior yourself?  When you can become a real man, maybe you'll...oh, wait, you'll NEVER be a real man.							</div>

								Offensive, disgusting, piggish, chauvinistic, pathetic, whiny, and full of bullshit.  Way to lie about your gender and stalk groups on Cafemom just to write a piece of crap article that will get bashed relentlessly.  As a YOUNGER Cafemom member, I find this dribble to be nothing more than an infantile male's attempt to make himself feel better about his sad, lonely existance.  There are a LOT of husbands who understand the obsession and even some who actually LIKE Twilight.  *insert shocked gasp here*  So, basically, this 'Rory' is just some overweight, middle-aged man who hasn't been laid in forever and feels the need to take his anger over these facts out on something that he doesn't understand.  Way to go.							</div>

								LMFAO  Seriously buddy.  You are funny.  You have plenty of half truths and exaggerations in your article to invalidate every thing you say.  It's also hilarious that you say how socially inept and sex starved we are yet neglect to mention that our HUSBANDS make comments on things that we share.  Such as the above quoted Taylor Lautner papz pic.  Many husbands were joking with us about it. That is the sign of a healthy marriage where our husbands are confident that we are not going to leave them for these OF AGE actors anymore than they'll be doing it to us for the young Hollywood female of the moment.  If you want to see young adults be ogled like pieces of meat go to the beach...or the mall or hell, the school yard.  Oh wait, that's different because men are expected to want sex 24/7 while we as women are only supposed to even do it as our wifely duty.  You sadden me.  If there is a woman who has the misfortune of having to procreate with you I pity her.  I really do.  You make Edward Cullen look like Prince Charming and that's not easy to do.							</div>

I am not super crazy about the books any longer, and the more I read them the more adolescent they seemed to me. Bella is crazy smart in the first book, but then turns in to a whining ninny in the last 3. I have watched all of the movies and they are okay if you really love corny. I am not going to try to defend them when I feel they are mostly crappy. I think you article is funny, though crude at times and that you posted it knowing you where going to get this response from so many teens and crazy mother.
